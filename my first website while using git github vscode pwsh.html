        <h3>Houston: Where Space Meets Culture</h3>
        <p>
            I started my Texas escapade in Houston, a city bustling with energy and innovation. The first stop? NASA's Space Center Houston. Walking through the Space Center was like stepping into a world of exploration and discovery. From moon rocks to space shuttle replicas, I couldn't help but feel inspired by humanity's quest for the stars.

        <p>
            Next up was Austin, the state capital and a city that marches to the beat of its own drumâ€”literally!

        <h3>Dallas-Fort Worth: Modernity and Old West Charm</h3>
        <p>
            Wrapping up my Texas odyssey, I ventured into the dynamic cities of Dallas and Fort Worth. Dallas' sleek skyline and bustling arts district captivated me, especially the poignant exhibits at the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. Fort Worth's Stockyards National Historic District transported me back to the Old West, with daily cattle drives and rodeo performances that celebrated Texas' cowboy heritage.
